<h1>Grid based masking</h1>
<p>This tool snaps points to the corners of a grid based on the input grid
    size.</p>

<h2>Input parameters</h2>

<h3>Input layer</h3>

<p>The input point data that will be snapped to the centre of the grid.</p>

<h3>Grid size</h3>

<p>The size of the grid in projected units to snap to. Units are in the
    projected units of the input layer.</p>

<h3>X Offset</h3>

<p>An X offset for the grid in map units so the grid doesn't need to be centred
    around the 0, 0 location.</p>

<h3>Y Offset</h3>

<p>A Y offset for the grid in map units so the grid doesn't need to be centred
    around the 0, 0 location.</p>

<h2>Output parameters</h2>

<h3>Anonymized features</h3>

<p>The output point layer that has the point geometries snapped to the corners
    of the grid defined by the grid size. The other attributes of the input
    dataset will be unchanged.</p>
