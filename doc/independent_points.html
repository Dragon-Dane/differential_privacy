<h1>Differenential privacy - independent points</h1>
<p>This algorithm implements the geo-indistinguishability algorithm as outlined
in <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>. Noise is generated on a 2D laplacian distribution based on the epsilon
value set in the plugin settings and the protection distance set in the tool.
The noise is generated and applied to each point individually within the
dataset - i.e. it assumes that the location of each points is completely
independent of the location of any other point within the dataset. As such
spatial statistics will only be relatively accurate based on the privacy level
set in the tool.</p>

<h2>Input parameters</h2>

<h3>Input layer</h3>

<p>Any point layer may be used as input. Note that the calculation is done on
a 2d plane in the projected units so care should be taken when looking at the
projection of the incoming dataset.</p>

<h3>Protection distance (projected units)</h3>

<p>An offset distance for the noise calculation. Approximately 59% of points
will be within this distance of their origin.</p>

<h2>Output parameters</h2>

<h3>Anonymized features</h3>

<p>A dataset with all the original attributes of the original dataset with the
points offset by a random amount. Note the offset of each point is independent
so if the spatial autocorrelation of the data is important at the original
resolution the utility may be lost using this tool.</p>
