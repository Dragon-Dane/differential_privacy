about=This QGIS Processing provider plugin implements different methods for the
    anonymization of spatial data (typically point samples) with the goal of making
    the data publicly available, while preserving the privacy of the individuals
    whose information the dataset contains (see [3]).

    The differential privacy algorithm is based on the algorithm outlined in [1]
    and implemented by Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis in the Location Guard
    browser extension [2].
