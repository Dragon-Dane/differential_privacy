qgisMinimumVersion=2.0

about=This plugin implements different methods for the anonymization of spatial
    data (typically point samples) with the goal of making the data publically
    available, while preserving the privacy of the individuals whose information
    the dataset contains.

    The differential privacy algorithm is based on the algorithm outlined in [1]
    and implemented by Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis in the Location Guard
    browser extension [2].
